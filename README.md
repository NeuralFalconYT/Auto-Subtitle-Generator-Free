Generate subtitles automatically from your videos or audio files using the **[Whisper-Large-V3-Turbo-CT2](https://huggingface.co/deepdml/faster-whisper-large-v3-turbo-ct2)** model.  


**Reason to make this:**  
When you try to generate captions for free, most editing software either charges money or imposes strict limitations, such as daily/monthly usage limits or short-duration restrictions.  
Even if they allow free use, they often add watermarks or downgrade videos to 720p doing every trick to force you to buy their software.  

This tool isn’t 100% perfect, but it completes about **80% of the work reliably**, providing a free and simple solution for subtitle generation.

### 🎬 Generate Subtitles
![app_1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a3909afd-dbc9-4c65-a3de-1d018e5b8451)

### 🔎 How Subtitle Generation Works
Upload an **audio or video file** → generate **word-level subtitles** using `Whisper-Large-V3-Turbo-CT2`,  
then process the word-level timestamps to create different subtitle formats.

By default, you get the **Whisper subtitles**, and after processing you get multiple variations:

```python
from subtitle import subtitle_maker

media_file = "video.mp4"
source_lang = "English"
target_lang = "English"

default_srt, translated_srt, custom_srt, word_srt, shorts_srt, txt_path, transcript = subtitle_maker(
    media_file, source_lang, target_lang
)

# If source_lang and target_lang are the same, translation will be skipped.
# ⚠️ Note: Translation uses Google Translator, which may not always give accurate results.  
# If you don’t need translation, set `source_lang` and `target_lang` to the same value.  
# This will skip translation and keep the original subtitles.

````

* **default\_srt** → Original subtitles generated directly by Whisper-Large-V3-Turbo-CT2
* **translated\_srt** → Translated subtitles (only if `source_lang ≠ target_lang`, e.g., English → Hindi)
* **custom\_srt** → Modified version of default subtitles with shorter segments (max 38 characters per line, better readability for horizontal videos)
* **word\_srt** → Word-level timestamps (useful for Shorts/Reels karaoke-style captions)
* **shorts\_srt** → Optimized for vertical videos (3–4 words at a time, max 17 characters per segment)
* **txt\_path** → Full transcript as plain text (useful for summarization or LLM-based Q\&A)
* **transcript** → Transcript text returned directly by the function

✅ All functionality is contained in a **single file**, making it portable and reusable across projects.

### 🌍 Translate Subtitles into Different Languages using LLM

![app\_2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5ec7b6f1-8d69-4397-9348-2a77eceaff4b)



## Feature 1: Subtitle Translation

### 📖 How Subtitle Translation Works

1. **Upload the `.srt` file generated by Whisper.**

2. **Choose the Translation task** in the app.

3. **Generate Prompt**
   Copy the generated prompt and paste it into [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/) or your preferred LLM tool.
   Do not change the JSON output structure:

   ```json
   {
     "subtitle sequence number": {
       "timestamp": "original timestamp",
       "actual subtitle text": "original subtitle line",
       "dubbing": <result>
     }
   }
   ```

4. **Copy the JSON Prompt Output**
   Paste the JSON prompt into AI Studio and copy the LLM result.

5. **Generate the Translated SRT File**
   Paste the JSON output back into the app → download the translated `.srt` file.

## Feature 2: Romanization

Convert subtitles from any non-Latin script into **Roman letters**.

* Example: `"नमस्ते, आप कैसे हैं ?"` → `"Namaste, aap kaise hain ?"`
* Useful for creating **dubbing-friendly subtitles** for audiences who don’t read the original language but can read English..

---

## Feature 3: Fix Grammar
**The main goal is English-to-English dubbing: change the voice and fix grammar.
After obtaining the corrected subtitles, you can use the SRT-to-audio conversion to generate audio, allowing you to dub the video or audio in English.
This is especially useful for those who are weak in English or don’t have a strong voice.**

**Optional: Generate Audio from SRT**
If you want to generate audio from the `.srt` file while preserving timestamps, you can try:

* [Kokoro TTS Subtitle on Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/spaces/NeuralFalcon/Kokoro-TTS-Subtitle)
* [Kokoro TTS Subtitle GitHub Repository](https://github.com/NeuralFalconYT/Kokoro-TTS-Subtitle)

This allows **basic video dubbing**.



## 🌐 Use Cases

* 🎥 YouTubers → Auto-generate and translate subtitles.  
* 🧑‍🏫 Teachers → Create multilingual educational content.  
* 📱 Social Media Influencers → Dub videos for different audiences.  
* 🌏 Movie/Anime Fans → Watch content in different languages with subtitles or dubbing.
