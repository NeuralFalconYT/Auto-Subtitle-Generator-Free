# 🎬 Auto Subtitle Generator (Free)

[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/NeuralFalconYT/Auto-Subtitle-Generator-Free/blob/main/Subtitle_Generator.ipynb)

Generate subtitles automatically from your videos or audio files using Whisper-Large-V3-Turbo-CT2 Model.  

**Reason to make this:**  
When you try to generate captions for free, most editing software either charges money or imposes strict limitations, such as daily/monthly usage limits or short-duration restrictions.  
Even if they allow free use, they often add watermarks or downgrade videos to 720p doing every trick to force you to buy their software.  

This tool isn’t 100% perfect, but it completes about **80% of the work reliably**, providing a free and simple solution for subtitle generation.

### 🎬 Generate Subtitles
![app_1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a3909afd-dbc9-4c65-a3de-1d018e5b8451)

### 🔎 How Subtitle Generation Works
Upload an **audio or video file** → generate **word-level subtitles** using `Whisper-Large-V3-Turbo-CT2`,  
then process the word-level timestamps to create different subtitle formats.

By default, you get the **Whisper subtitles**, and after processing you get multiple variations:

```python
from subtitle import subtitle_maker

media_file = "video.mp4"
source_lang = "English"
target_lang = "English"

default_srt, translated_srt, custom_srt, word_srt, shorts_srt, txt_path, transcript = subtitle_maker(
    media_file, source_lang, target_lang
)

# If source_lang and target_lang are the same, translation will be skipped.
# ⚠️ Note: Translation uses Google Translator, which may not always give accurate results.  
# If you don’t need translation, set `source_lang` and `target_lang` to the same value.  
# This will skip translation and keep the original subtitles.

````

* **default\_srt** → Original subtitles generated directly by Whisper-Large-V3-Turbo-CT2
* **translated\_srt** → Translated subtitles (only if `source_lang ≠ target_lang`, e.g., English → Hindi)
* **custom\_srt** → Modified version of default subtitles with shorter segments (max 38 characters per line, better readability for horizontal videos)
* **word\_srt** → Word-level timestamps (useful for Shorts/Reels karaoke-style captions)
* **shorts\_srt** → Optimized for vertical videos (3–4 words at a time, max 17 characters per segment)
* **txt\_path** → Full transcript as plain text (useful for summarization or LLM-based Q\&A)
* **transcript** → Transcript text returned directly by the function

✅ All functionality is contained in a **single file**, making it portable and reusable across projects.

### 🌍 Translate Subtitles into Different Languages using LLM

## 📖 How Subtitle Translation Works

1. **Upload the `.srt` file generated by Whisper**

2. **Choose a Task**

   * **Translation** → Translate subtitles into your chosen language.
   * **Fix Grammar** → Clean up subtitles while keeping them in English (useful for dubbing).

3. **Generate Prompt**
   Copy the generated prompt and paste it into [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/) or your preferred LLM tool.
   You can modify the prompt rules according to your needs, but **do not change this part**:

   ```json
   {
     "subtitle sequence number": {
       "timestamp": "original timestamp",
       "actual subtitle text": "original English subtitle line",
       "dubbing": <result>
     }
   }
   ```

4. **Copy the JSON Prompt Output**  
   Paste the JSON prompt into AI Studio.  
   - After the LLM generates the translated JSON result, copy it.  
   - You can use **any LLM** that works well for short-duration audio/video.  
   - For long content, **Google AI Studio is recommended** since it supports up to **1 million tokens**.  

5. **Generate the Translated SRT File**  
   Paste the JSON output back into the app → download the translated `.srt` file.


6. **Optional: Generate Audio from SRT**  
   If you want to generate audio from the `.srt` file while preserving timestamps, you can try:  

   - [Kokoro TTS Subtitle on Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/spaces/NeuralFalcon/Kokoro-TTS-Subtitle)  
   - [Kokoro TTS Subtitle GitHub Repository](https://github.com/NeuralFalconYT/Kokoro-TTS-Subtitle)  

This allows you to do **basic video dubbing**, but it’s not perfect,  I’m not a pro coder,  
it is still possible to generate audio from SRT for **video dubbing**.  

For reference:  
- YouTube is rolling out its own video dubbing feature.  
- There are many paid tools that provide dubbing features, such as Eleven Labs, but all require payment.

If you’re interested, you can give it a try and experiment with your own SRT files.
